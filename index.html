      <p>
        I played Elden Ring last year! I'm going to review it. It was the only game I played last
        year since it was so long, so it took a long time for me to get to Silent Hill 2. It will
        probably be a long review in terms of the number of things I want to say about it, so I'm
        going to leave it until the next post.
        I liked this game, but there were problems I had with it, but I liked it. It's a bit of a
        surprise to me, since I hate Dark Souls, but I liked it because there was way more build
        variety, and they have this new thing called guard counters where you can attack after a
        block, so the combat isn't so slow. You still have the dumb rolling system though.

        The main thing I liked about Elden Ring was that you could be a magic user and it was
        really fun. They say it's easy mode but I think they should make Elden Ring different from
        Dark Souls by just making summons and magic more important. I can't think of many games
        that make magic as fun as Elden Ring.
        I also really like the setting. It's almost at the level of Kenshi in terms of how much I
        liked it, in that it does almost everything right in its worldbuilding. It's original but
        rooted in the history of fantasy. Whoever decided the dialogue should be written in Early
        Modern English tho, or as they probably think its called, Old English, needs to be fired,
        because not only is it difficult to recreate that style, but they didn't even come close.
